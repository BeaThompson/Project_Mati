1. SIEM Pipeline Breakdown

Step 1: Log Collection

Log collection starts by deploying agents or setting up syslog to gather data from all relevant sources. This includes Windows Event Logs, Linux auditd, firewall logs, endpoint protection solutions, and EDR platforms. The goal is full visibility across your environment.

It is critical to enforce strict time synchronization using NTP across all systems. If timestamps are out of sync, correlation becomes impossible, and your pipeline integrity degrades fast.

Step 2: Log Normalization

Once logs are collected, the next phase is normalization. Every log source is different, so you need to transform them into a consistent format like JSON. Normalization aligns fields across sources: timestamp, src_ip, dst_ip, src_port, dst_port, user, event_id, and process_name are non-negotiable.

Step 3: Log Enrichment

Enrichment is where you add context to raw logs. This might include GeoIP lookups to resolve IPs to locations, DNS resolutions to map domains, and threat intel enrichment to flag known bad indicators. You should also tag assets with metadata, like criticality or owner, to prioritize alerts effectively.

Step 4: Storage

After normalization and enrichment, data needs a scalable and searchable home. Elasticsearch, Splunk, or any comparable time-series database works. The priority is ensuring you can query fast and retain data as needed for detection and compliance.

Step 5: Detection Layer

Now youâ€™re ready to apply detection logic. This is where Sigma rules come in. Focus on custom rules first because off-the-shelf detections rarely understand your unique environment. Use your understanding of your systems to shape detection logic that matters.

Step 6: Alerting + SOAR

Once detections fire, alerts should feed directly into a SOAR platform or incident response tool. Automate enrichment steps here so that every alert includes attached artifacts, evidence, and contextual impact data. This makes triage and escalation faster.
