# Project_Mati
A collection of Sigma detection rules and supporting labs developed for use in blue team environments. These rules are designed to support detection engineering workflows and can be adapted for integration with platforms such as Wazuh and Elastic. Labs are included to demonstrate real-world attack techniques and validate detection logic. Each rule follows Sigma standards and includes relevant metadata for use in operational SIEM pipelines.
